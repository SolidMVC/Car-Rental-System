# Car Rental System (Native WordPress Plugin)
<p>It&#8217;s a high quality, native and responsive WordPress plugin to rent a car, created by experienced Silicon Valley engineers. 100% of it&#8217;s code is written by using native WordPress functions, so it much faster and secure than other similar plugins. Also &#8211; we made it compatible with WordPress Multisite, WPML &#38; Multi-language setup with native support for WordPress date, email &#38; time settings.<br /><br />
    Plus &#8211; we love mobile-first designs &#8211; that&#8217;s why we used Bootstrap, Font Awesome icons, Slick Slider, CSS3 and HTML5 techniques with smooth image resizing to 4 different sizes to make sure that your cars would look great on all mobile devices, tablets, full-screen previews and pages with many WordPress free &#38; Premium designs &#8211; like <a href="https://wpcarrental.com/">WP Car Rental</a> (most favorable), <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/cars4rent-car-rental-taxi-service/19669503">Cars4Rent</a> (popular), <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/tantum-car-scooter-rental-services-wordpress-theme/24757667">TanTum</a> (new), <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/2833226">Avada</a> or <a href="https://themeforest.net/item/betheme-responsive-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/7758048">BeTheme</a>  theme.<br /><br />
    Now both &#8211; your car rental business and website can run smoothly, by accepting online reservations and managing your entire fleet, from one control panel. By offering highly-customizable reservation system, your customers will be able to see vehicles availability, and make online reservations with a few clicks.
